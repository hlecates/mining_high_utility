## High Utility Itemset Mining
A comprehensive repository featuring four distinct high utility itemset mining algorithm implementations, alongside experiment scripts and empirical results.

# Algorithms
All implementations are provided as interactive Jupyter notebooks for ease of exploration:
* Two-Phase TWU/Apriori Approach
* IHUP
* UP-Growth
* HUI-Miner

# Experiments
Individual Python files of each algorithm and experiment scripts are housed in the experiments directory. This contains runtime, scalability, and candidate comparisons, as well as the associated plot generation. Contained in experiments/results are several generated plots shwoing emprirical results.
